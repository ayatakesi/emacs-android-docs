#. type: Plain text
#: README_nowrap:114
msgid "Long answer: because Android restricts both the locations from where executable files can be loaded and the names of the executables that it will extract from installation packages, Emacs files all of its ancillary executables under names resembling shared libraries.  When Emacs is installed, Android extracts these executables to a private directory that Emacs symlinks at startup to `lib' within the parent directory of its home directory.  Refer to (elisp)Subprocess Creation and (emacs)Android Environment for more details."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: README_nowrap:117
msgid "While the names of these executables are stable (and will be so for the forseeable future), it is better to use the variables that are specifically defined to provide their names: `emacsclient-program-name', `movemail-program-name' and so on, in place of hard-coded names such as `libemacsclient.so' and `libmovemail.so'.  Following this advice will guarantee that your code continues to run faithfully in the future and on non-Android systems."

msgid "The location of `emacs' is more involved: the `libemacs.so' is actually a real shared library containing all of the Emacs C code.

msgid "`libandroid-emacs.so' is a binary that tries to invoke the JVM with the right arguments for starting Emacs on the command line.  While it is true that Emacs cannot create a display connection when started in this manner, the greatest difficulty posed by this approach is rather its reliance on Android internals that are subject to change without notice.  Because of this unfortunate dependency, it does not work reliably on all versions of Android, and must be revised after each major change to the OS."

This is a very unwise decision on Android: any operation performed from a keyboard can also be performed from the menu bar or tool bar (including M-x, which is Edit -> Execute Command), making the use of a keyboard unnecessary."

msgstr ""

msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: README_nowrap:174
msgid "One extremely common transgression committed by input methods is to assume that the `getExtractedText' IME request will always reply with the entire contents of the buffer regardless of the number of characters the IME requests, which is indeed the case when the editor is the Android TextView widget.  In contrast, Emacs respects the size specified in the request, in adherence with the documented behavior for that request."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: README_nowrap:177
msgid "An additional transgression is assuming that, since the result of that request is always the entirety of the text buffer's contents, the caret offset returned by the input method is the position of the insertion point.  In reality, the base of this offset is the start of the text returned."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: README_nowrap:180
msgid "Together, these two implementation mistakes result in many problematic input methods misleading themselves into thinking that point is at the start of the buffer.  After inserting a closing paren as part of their own electric-pair features, such input methods often try to obtain the location of the point and move to the last character prior to the closing paren.  But what they think is the position of that character is actually the very beginning of the buffer."
